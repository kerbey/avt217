		7. Argumentative essays
		Argumentative essays try to convince the reader to take a certain side based on the information the writer presents. Argumentative essays rely on facts rather than emotion to sway the readers. For instance, an argumentative essay may discuss why companies should offer wellness packages as part of their benefits plan. The essay can incorporate research about how regular exercise increases productivity and how people who eat well and work out take fewer sick days.

		Argumentative essays avoid first- or second-person statements. Rather, they support one side of an argument and may argue against other sides using objective information. You can use phrases like "Research suggests" or "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention" to present the facts that support your argument.
