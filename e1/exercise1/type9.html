		9. Cause and effect essays
		Cause and effect essays detail why certain events or situations led to other events. Writers create a clear connection between the two sets of events or circumstances and explain what features of the initiating event created the subsequent incidents. Cause and effect essays are types of expository essays, so they state facts and avoid subjective opinions. A cause and effect essay may examine how Charles Darwin's scientific discoveries led to the origin of new theories of social science, for instance.
