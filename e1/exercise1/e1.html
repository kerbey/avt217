		<p><strong>By: Jamie Birt</strong></p>
		<p>Effective written communication is a necessary skill for many jobs, so professionals can convey a message by explaining or describing their ideas. One way to do this is with an essay, and several common types help writers streamline their work into a piece that’s clear, focused and well-organized. Learning about these documents can help you write them better and communicate your ideas more clearly.

		In this article, we discuss what essays are and list 10 common types of essays for you to consider.

		<p>What are essays?
		Essays are long-form writing assignments that persuade or inform a reader about a particular topic. It's important to know which type of essay to use to best deliver your message to readers. When you choose the type of essay most relevant to your topic, you can tailor your essay to your readers and be more organized.

		In some cases, such as school or job applications, someone decides which type of essay you write. Other times, you choose what type of essay to write. You may use an essay to convince readers to take your side, explore an abstract topic or try to evoke an emotional response. You often select an essay type based on what you're trying to accomplish. For example, if you want to teach the reader how to do something, you may use a process essay that breaks the directions into individual steps.</p>

			1. Narrative essays
		Narrative essays tell a story and often are the most personal type of essay you may write. They allow you to exercise creativity and imagination, and you can base them on a particular prompt, such as the first time you drove a car by yourself, or a more open-ended prompt, like a time you overcame a fear. You may submit a narrative essay, usually called a personal statement, for college or graduate school applications.

		You can use literary techniques in narrative essays to create an essay that reads like fiction. To do this, consider including metaphors, analogies, alliteration, imagery and dialogue. A narrative essay generally has an opening that gets the reader's attention and provides enough background information for the story to make sense. A conclusion helps summarize the main point of your essay or reiterate your goals. For example, if you’re writing a narrative essay for a job application, you could conclude by summarizing how your experience solidified your desire to become a lawyer.
