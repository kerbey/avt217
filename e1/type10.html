		10. Critical essays
		Critical essays provide an in-depth analysis of a topic. They can critique paintings, books, movies, plays or restaurants. Many college courses, especially literature and humanities courses, require critical essays as a way to test students' ability to think critically and identify evidence from a specific work that validates their observations. Critical essays use facts from the subject to justify an opinion. For instance, in a movie review, a writer could note a movie uses boring dialogue. They then could support that observation by citing specific lines from the film.
