		2. Descriptive essays
		Descriptive essays provide a detailed description of your subject. This may be a person, place, thing or event. Descriptive essays, like narrative essays, allow for a more creative approach to writing. Unlike narrative essays, which provide a complete story, descriptive essays often focus only on the subject.

		When writing a descriptive essay, consider including vivid imagery and incorporate actions, thoughts, sensory details and emotions to immerse the reader instead of simply explaining the situation or events. You can do this by using strong action verbs and unique, descriptive adjectives. This can make your writing more engaging and help the reader feel more involved and connected to your essay and its characters.
