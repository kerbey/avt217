		8. Persuasive essays
		Persuasive essays aim to persuade readers to have an opinion or take a side using facts and emotional appeals. To support an argument or cause, persuasive essays can include moral and emotional reasoning to connect to the reader.

		For example, a persuasive essay about the previous topic of companies including wellness packages in employee benefits may include appeals to employers' satisfaction with providing an extra perk for their employees. It also could discuss employers' responsibility to ensure their employees have access to features that keep them healthy or how excited and grateful employees are for the new benefits.
