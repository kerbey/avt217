	<p>3. Last month, as an exercise in outside-the-box advertising in conjunction with their corporate sponsor Pepsi Next, BuzzFeed launched something called the ListiClock, a Web page that displays a flip clock with a BuzzFeed listicle for every hour, minute, and second of the day. As of this writing, for instance, the time is precisely 2:27:47 p.m., and this fleeting moment is illustrated by the following listicles: “2 Messages from the Romney Campaign,” “27 Toys You Threw Out That Are Worth a Fortune Now,” and “47 Superb Owls.” (I clicked on the owls, fearing that I would never again have a chance to see them; they were, to be fair, uniformly superb.)
